# Advait's AOC ReasonML Attempts

Advait is stumbling his way through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [ReasonML](http://reasonmlhub.com/exploring-reasonml/ch_about-reasonml.html#what-is-reasonml). Follow his misadventures here.

# Build
```
npm run build
```

This will create a bunch of bucklescript-based JS files in the src folder. Simply run them like:

```
node src/advent3.bs.js
```

# Build + Watch

```
npm run start
```

This will watch the reason files and continually update the generated JS. Watch out for syntax errors... ReasonML is alpha quality software.
