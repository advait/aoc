# Advait's AOC ReasonML Attempts

Advait is stumbling his way through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [ReasonML](http://reasonmlhub.com/exploring-reasonml/ch_about-reasonml.html#what-is-reasonml), Haskell, and Elm. Follow his misadventures here:

  - The [2019/elm](https://github.com/advait/aoc/tree/master/2019/elm?ts=2) directory contains Elm implementations.
  - The [2018/haskell/](https://github.com/advait/aoc/tree/master/2018/haskell?ts=2) directory contains Haskell implementations.
  - The [2018/reasonml-bucklescript/](https://github.com/advait/aoc/tree/master/2018/reasonml-bucklescript?ts=2) directory contains ReasonML implementations to be complied with [Bucklescript](https://bucklescript.github.io/).
  - The [2018/reasonml-dune/](https://github.com/advait/aoc/tree/master/2018/reasonml-dune?ts=2) directory contains ReasonML implementations to be compiled with [Dune](https://dune.build/).
